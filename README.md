This project simulates a hospital network infrastructure connecting multiple departments including Admin, Emergency (ER), Outpatient (OP), and Pharmacy using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is designed to ensure efficient communication between departments while securing external access with NAT (Network Address Translation).
